Hi! This is Mengwei Ding. I am now an Eng lead at Facebook. Currently, I am a part of the mission
building Creators ecosystem on Facebook App, reclaiming Facebook's territory from our competitors, starting from H2'21.
Before that, I led a team build audience workstreams of [*Live Audio Room*](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-on-facebook/) product, and its distribution and discovery channels from scratch, catching the tide in live audio space.

Prior to Facebook, I was a *Principal Software Engineer II* at [*Elastic*](https://elastic.co), the company
behind *Elasticsearch*. Joined force with *Elastic* after the acqusition on 07/2018
 ([Blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/welcome-insight-io-to-the-elastic-team)).
Focused on reinventing code search on top of the *Elastic Stack*.

I was a Co-Founder of [*Insight.io*](https://insight.io). Incubated a side project into this startup with friends, aiming
at cracking any efficiency issues of software development processes with our code intelligence technology.

I joined *Google* [*Product Ads*](https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/) Team as a software engineer
right after school, working on the serving backend, product, and growth.
Some works were shared on *Google Performance Summit 2016 [Keynote (28:02)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1LS94wLJw)*.

I am also a member of [*Apache Software Foundation*](https://apache.org). I acquired the
[commitership](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#mengwei) during my summer internship at
[*Cloudera*](https://cloudera.com).

I hold a *[M.S. Computational Data Science](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/)*
from *Carnegie Mellon University*. Before that, in China, I acquired *M.S.* degree from *Shanghai Jiao Tong University
(上海交通大学)* and *B.S.* degree from *Harbin Institute of Technology
(哈尔滨工业大学)*, both in Computer Science. Got my B.S. degree before 20.

In my spare time, [books and movies](https://www.douban.com/people/lennard/)
are my best friends. I taught myself swimming young and loved it since then.
