I am now Co-Founder of [*Insight.io*](https://insight.io). Incubated a side project into this startup, aiming
to crack any efficiency issues of software development process by our code intelligence technology.

I joined *Google* [*Product Ads*](https://www.google.com/retail/solutions/) Team as a software engineer
right after school, focusing on the serving backend, product, and growth.
Some works were shared on *Google Performance Summit 2016 [Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1LS94wLJw)*.

I am also a member of [*Apache Software Foundation*](https://apache.org). I acquired the
[commitership](http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html#mengwei) during my summer internship at

I hold a *[M.S. Computational Data Science](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/)*

In my spare time, [books and movies](https://www.douban.com/people/lennard/)
